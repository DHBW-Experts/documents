## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) describes all specifications for the application "DHBW-Experts". It includes an overview about this project and its vision, detailed information about the planned features and boundary conditions of the development process.

### 1.2 Scope

The project is going to be realized as an Android and IOS App, but won't be released in their associated App stores due to the need of a developer Account.

Actors of this App can be users or admins.

Planned Subsystems are:

- Account system
 A user can create an account and the account data will be encrypted and stored in an Azure SQL database.
- Mail server
The mail server will be used to verify that all emails belong to the domain @student.dhbw-karlsruhe.de.
- Database and their corresponding API
The database will store all of the userdata, skilltags and the login data for every user.
- Skill confirmation system
Users will be able to confirm that another user has a certain skill.
- Search for skilltags
Users will be able to find other users by searching for skilltags.

### 1.5 Overview

The following chapter provides an overview of this project with vision and Overall Use Case Diagram. The third chapter (Requirements Specification) delivers more details about the specific requirements in terms of functionality, usability and design parameters. Finally there is a chapter with supporting information.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Vision

The very basic idea is to create an easy way for students to find experts concerning a specific subject. We want to create an app, which will enable our users to create a profile, where one can link any certain topic, they are an Expert in. This will be possible by adding hashtags (e.g., #C++ or #BWL, although you can add non-DHBW-related tags like #csgo or #Tax too) alongside their DHBW-related personal information to their student profile. These tags can be searched by anyone needing help, creating an expertise-database.

Nowadays, almost every smartphone can scan NFC-Chips and we think it is possible to link more information to the NFC-Chip than just your cafeteria balance. This is why we want to encourage our users to voluntarily link their RFID student ID card to our app to create their own digital business card - Just scan someoneâ€™s ID with our app and get an overview of who you are dealing with. Find out what they are good at and enjoy an instant conversation starter.

Our app should be available as an Android and iOS-app (Although it will be almost impossible to deploy without an Apple Developer account) using Ionic. Ionic allows you to develop an application that works flexible on iOS, android and pcs.

## 3. Specific Requirements

### 3.1 Functionality

This section will explain the different use cases, you could see in the Use Case Diagram, and their functionality.  
Until December we plan to implement:

- 3.1.1 Scanning an ID
- 3.1.2 adding skilltags to an Account
- 3.1.3 Creating an account
- 3.1.4 Logging in
- 3.1.5 Logging out
- 3.1.6 Email validation

Until June, we want to implement:

- 3.1.7 search for different skilltags
- 3.1.8 confirmation of skilltags by other users


#### 3.1.1 Scanning an ID

Every account will be linked to a student ID. To add an student ID to your Account, simply scan the ID with an NFC capable smartphone. 

#### 3.1.2 adding skilltags to an Account

Every user can show their skills by adding their personal skilltags to their profile. Skilltags can also be removed.

#### 3.1.3 Creating an account

To identify all users we need an account system. This account system enables us to build important functions such as scanning the student ID from someone else to get information about their skilltags.

#### 3.1.4 Logging in

The app will provide the possibility to register and log in.

#### 3.1.5 Logging out

In case you share your phone or just want to be cautius about your privacy you should be able to manually log out.

#### 3.1.6 Email validation

Every user needs to confirm that they are a student at the DHBW by verifying their email adress.

#### 3.1.7 search for different skilltags

A user can search for different skill tags and find other users that have this skill.

#### 3.1.8 confirmation of skilltags by other users

Users can confirm that another user has a certain skill as specified on their profile.

### 3.2 Usability

We plan on designing the user interface as intuitive and self-explanatory as possible to make the user feel as comfortable as possible using the app.

#### 3.2.1 Training time

It might take the user a short amount of time to understand the purpose of the app. Besides that, our goal is that a user installs the application, opens it and is able to use all features without any help.

### 3.3 Reliability

#### 3.3.1 Availability

The server shall be available 95% of the time. This also means we have to figure out the "rush hours" of our app because the downtime of the server is only tolerable when as few as possible players want to use the app.

#### 3.3.2 Defect Rate

Our goal is that we have no loss of any data. This is important so that the game sessions can carry on, even after a downtime of the server.

### 3.4 Perfomance

#### 3.4.1 Capacity

The system should be able to manage thousands of requests. Also it should be possible to register as many users as necessary.

#### 3.4.2 Storage

Smartphones don't provide much storage. Therefore we are aiming to keep the needed storage as small as possible.

#### 3.4.3 App perfomance / Response time

To provide the best App perfomance we aim to keep the response time as low as possible. This will make the user experience much better.

### 3.5 Supportability

#### 3.5.1 Coding Standards

We are going to write the code by using all of the most common clean code standards. For example we will name our variables and methods by their functionalities. This will keep the code easy to read by everyone and make further developement much easier.

#### 3.5.2 Testing Strategy

The application will have a high test coverage and all important functionalities and edge cases should be tested. Further mistakes in the implementation will be discovered instantly and it will be easy to locate the error.

### 3.6 Design Constraints

We are trying to provide a modern and easy to handle design for the UI aswell as for the architecture of our application. To achieve that the functionalities will be kept as modular as possible.

Because we are progamming an Android App we chose Java as our programming language. Also we are using the common MVC-architecture to keep the front end and back end seperated. For a clean front end structure we use MVVM.
To make the communication between the two parts easy, we will implement a RESTful-API between them which will provide the data in JSON-Format.
The supported Platforms will be:

- Android 4.4 and higher
- Java 8 and higher

### 3.7 On-line User Documentation and Help System Requirements

The usage of the app should be as intuitive as possible so it won't need any further documentation. The Blog could also be used of our team could also be used in case any of the functions are not clear.

### 3.8 Purchased Components

We don't have any purchased components yet. If there will be purchased components in the future we will list them here.

### 3.9 Interfaces

#### 3.9.1 User Interfaces

The User interfaces that will be implented are:

- Login - this page is used to log in
- Register - provides a registration form
- Friend List - friends can be added (TODO will we implementing a friend feature??)
- Edit Profile - own personal information can be edited and skilltags can be added
- View Profile - view the profile of a specific user 
- Search - search for a user by specific skilltags
- Settings - shows the settings

#### 3.9.2 Hardware Interfaces

NFC Sanner

#### 3.9.3 Software Interfaces

The app will be runnable on modern version of Android and IOS. 

#### 3.9.4 Communication Interfaces

The server and hardware will communicate using the http protocol.

### 3.10 Licensing Requirements

### 3.11 Legal, Copyright, and Other Notices

The logo is licensed to the DHBW-Experts Team and is only allowed to use for the application. We do not take responsibilty for any incorrect data or errors in the application.

### 3.12 Applicable Standards

The development will follow the common clean code standards and naming conventions. Also we will create a definition of d which will be added here as soon as its complete.
